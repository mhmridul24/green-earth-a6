1) What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?

var → function-scoped, can be re-declared and re-assigned, hoisted.

let → block-scoped, can be re-assigned, cannot be re-declared in same scope.

const → block-scoped, cannot be re-assigned or re-declared.

2) What is the difference between `map()`, `forEach()`, and `filter()`?

forEach() → loops through array, does something, does not return a new array.

map() → loops through array, returns a new array with modified values.

filter() → loops through array, returns a new array with items that satisfy a condition.

3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
A shorter way to write functions: const add = (a, b) => a + b

4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Extract values from arrays or objects into variables easily. Destructuring assignment in ES6 is a way to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a very clean way. It helps avoid writing repetitive code.

5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Template literals are a way to create strings using backticks () instead of quotes ('or"`). They let you:

i. Embed variables easily

ii. Write multi-line strings

iii. Include expressions directly inside strings
